                    Prof. Ekeanyanwu is the first CIMARC Scholar from Nigeria. He achieved this feat after winning the 2013-2014 edition of the Centre for International Media Analysis, Research & Consultancy (CIMARC) Scholarship for West African Researchers. He was one of the three West African researchers who benefited from the Scholarship for the 2013-2014 academic session. The Departments of Media and Law of the University of Bedfordshire, Luton, United Kingdom, sponsored the Scholarship. The scholarship made Prof. Ekeanyanwu a Short-Term Visiting Scholar at the University of Bedfordshire. The Scholarship covered his international and local travels, accommodation, feeding, and subsistence throughout the duration of the scholarship tenure. During the scholarship tenure, Prof. Ekeanyanwu, who was referred to as CIMARC Scholar, delivered a research seminar paper, contributed a workshop to the sponsoring Departments’ Masters programmes in International Journalism and International Human Rights Law and engaged in discussions about possible joint research projects. Professor Ekeanyanwu also delivered seminal lectures at the School of Communication, London School of Economics and Political Science; School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, England; Department of Journalism, University of Sussex, England; and the University of Bedfordshire in Luton, England. The same year, Prof. Ekeanyanwu was hosted by the Parliamentarian representing Luton Town in the iconic British Parliament in London, United Kingdom.

                    Prof. Ekeanyanwu became the National President of ACCE in 2017 and has made many giant strides since he assumed Office. His in-born passion for communication education in Nigeria saw him champion the introduction of features that moved the Council to a position of reckoning in Africa. Ekeanyanwu’s exceptional contributions which changed the face of ACCE began while he was the National Coordinating Secretary of the Council from 2012 to 2017. This was a period the Council was effectively aligned with the digital world, expanding the membership base with more online contacts, moving the ACCE Secretariat into the cyberspace with visible advantages. He then became the National President in 2017 with more policies that made the council much more in line with what obtained in other international communication-based organisations/professional bodies of great reckoning across the world such as the International Communication Association (ICA) and Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication (AEJMC). Today, ACCE operates in divisions, with more organised and specialist-based conferences and paper presentations. The membership base has continued to increase with more participation by Nigerian scholars based in the US and Europe. The Nigerian chapter of ACCE has assumed a more powerful position as one of the most-sought-after communication associations in Africa, a major reason for more participations from Nigerian communication scholars in the diaspora.

                    Founded in 1974, The ACCE is a non-political and non-profit-making organisation concerned with the basic purpose of fostering communication education in Africa. It is the biggest association and forum for media professionals, educators in journalism and cultural studies and associated disciplines in Africa. Prof. Ekeanyanwu has ensured that the vision of the founding fathers of ACCE has only remained aflame but moved to an enviable height necessary for progress in communication education in Nigeria in today’s dynamic, digital world. He has brought his experiences as a refined scholar to the fore with a view to ensuring that scholarship in communication and media studies in Nigeria is at par with what obtains in the Western world. This, he believes could be achieved through a formidable association such as the ACCE.

                    Prof. Ekeanyanwu is a confirmed scholar, teacher, and inspirational role model. One contact with him could change a person’s career based on the advice he would provide on the next best way to achieve academic goals. If you ask around you would find that he has actually impacted careers of some of his colleagues through such one-in-a-lifetime contacts. He is among the few communication scholars in Nigeria in today’s digital world where instantaneous access to information, cash-and-carry online publications and fast-lane promotions have seriously impeded the prevalence of quality communication education scholarship. Ekeanyanwu remains one of the few scholars in Nigeria who possess qualities that can inspire anyone to take up communication education as a profession. His honesty, grit, and perseverance are rare virtues that stand him out in Nigeria’s communication education landscape.

                    Professor Nnamdi Ekeanyanwu has often argued that a teacher without a teacher is a fake. By that philosophy, Prof. Ekeanyanwu has maintained links with academic giants that mentored him and has continued to refer to his teachers with respect and humility. Today, he is a proud member and senior boy in the Professor Chinyere Stella Okunna mentorship group. Ekeanyanwu proudly identifies Prof. Chinyere Stella Okunna as his teacher, mentor and role model. Mr. Chairman, Special Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to you Prof. Nnamdi Tobechukwu Ekeanyanwu.
